# Fall of Artica

> In his 1979 book, "What is Universal Pragmatics?", JÃ¼rgen Habermas posits that human rivalry, disputes, and tactical maneuvers are essentially failed efforts to reach mutual understanding, hindered by misunderstandings about intentions or states of affairs.

"Fall of Artica (FoA)" is an open-source game that unfolds within a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world that plunges players into a science fiction narrative with the unresolved societal issues of our times. By leveraging the concept of "Fictional Distance"[1] and employing a participatory action learning framework[2], FoA invites players into a pluralistic exploration of complex modern dilemmas such as freedom and safety, the present and the future, as well as value and utility. This game not only fosters critical thinking but also offers an immersive yet safe space for individuals to engage with and reflect upon societal conflicts deeply.
