# FoA-game
“Fall of Artica”: A Way Back Home (FoA). In a dystopian world named “Artica”, FoA can take different forms to fit different disciplines or epistemological forms. In the present study, the game addressed the topic of a nontraditional hero’s journey, emphasizing a pluralistic perspective that includes tensions among various positions. We employed a design-based research method [3] informed by “Fictional Distance” guidelines [1], as well as a participatory action learning framework to guide our designs [5]. Students explore con- temporary issues through a fictional, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian game narrative, which can sometimes challenge the traditional hero’s journey [4, 24]. FoA supports students’ inquiries into the complexities of
modern dilemmas within a game-based learning environment. This paper reports on the first iteration, where students inquire about diverse themes and ideas encapsulated within six distinct regions. Interacting with Non-Playing Characters (NPC) in the form of AI chat-bots (Author), students engage in social conflicts. FoA provides a safe environment to express, challenge, and refine their identity and experience within public spheres, such as classrooms or wider educational communities.

In Jürgen Habermas's 1979 book, "What is Universal Pragmatics?", he posits that human rivalry, disputes, and tactical maneuvers are failed efforts to reach mutual understanding, hindered by misunderstandings about intentions or states of affairs.

"Fall of Artica (FoA)" is an open-source game that unfolds within a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world that plunges players into a science fiction narrative with the unresolved societal issues of our times. By leveraging the concept of "Fictional Distance"[1] and employing a participatory action learning framework[2], FoA invites players into a pluralistic exploration of complex modern dilemmas such as freedom and safety, the present and the future, as well as value and utility. This game fosters critical thinking and offers an immersive yet safe space for individuals to engage with and deeply reflect upon societal conflicts.
